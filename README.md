# Information

This Git repository is a direct decompilation and documentation project for the
1998 Windows PC game "Twisted Metal 2".

The goal of this project is to eventually compile an open-source Win32 executable which
can slot in place of the original executable and use the original assets.

After this project's completion, a full engine reimplementation in a modern language
with portability in mind would be the next step.
